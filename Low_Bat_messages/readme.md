Smart notifications for Node-Red in Home Assistant üéâÔ∏è
================================

This flow allows to create a messaging system for low batteries notification in Home Assistant quite easily.
You don't need to add a new notification service for a new battery device anymore.

I have implemented different notifications for three type of battery powered devices.
Note: You have to follow some naming convention for the devices to make it work this way.

- Thermostat Heating Battery
- Thermo/Hygrometer Zigbee 
- Mobile devices
